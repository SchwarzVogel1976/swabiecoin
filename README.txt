Project: Implement and Deploy an ERC-20 Fungible Token

Introduction
The ERC-20 token standard was introduced by Ethereum to provide a tokenization layer on
top of its smart contract and native cryptocurrency infrastructure. We covered the details of
fungible tokens and the ERC-20 standard in the course videos. In this project, you will apply
that knowledge by developing your own ERC-20 token. You’ll customize and deploy it on the
Sepolia test network, and interact with it by executing some of its core functions.
Outcomes

Upon completing this project, you will be able to:
1.​ Develop a fungible token (FT) using an ERC-20 token specification.
2.​ Understand the code to implement an ERC-20 token and update it to your
specifications.
3.​ Deploy the ERC-20 FT on an Ethereum testnet (Sepolia).
4.​ Explore working with an ERC-20 FT by interacting with the deployed token.

Pre-requisites
1.​ MetaMask wallet is installed
2.​ Sepolia testnet is added
3.​ Collected at least 0.03 Sepolia test ether from a faucet in your (MetaMask) wallet
4.​ Familiarity with Remix IDE
